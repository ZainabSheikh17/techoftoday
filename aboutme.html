        <p class = "description">
            As someone who's background education is in biology research, the software and digital world appeared really fascinating. 
            Throughout the last few months I have developed a large amount of interest in IT and software development. 
            This led me to join the course with codenation as I was really keen to gain knowledge on the fundamentals of coding and its practice. 
            After observing individuals around me that were deeply involved in the software and digital world,
            I also felt attracted to acquire an understanding of the IT and software industry. 
            I believe the world at large is now some way or the other implementing technology or its resources in their day to day life, 
            therefore, I should also understand and build into its foundation.
