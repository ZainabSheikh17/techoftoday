            <div id = "content" class="content">
    
            <p>
            In the last decade, the vast majority of society is operating IT in both modern business or personal use. 
            The use of IT in modern business serves a purpose to build better communication within and outside of the workplaces.
            Most modern businesses use social platforms and web technology to stay connected to colleagues and clients , in order to upload and present information online. 
            <br>
            This has largely impacted the efficiency and workflow in modern businesses, as it is now competitively easier and faster to construct association with the public.
            The personal use of IT such as social media (instagram, facebook, twitter), and online shopping sites such as ebay, benefits modern businesses to a large extent, as businesses are able to advertise and market internationally without having to travel.

        <h2 class= "title">1.2 Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
        <div id = "content2" class = "content">
            <p>
            In order to build and run a digital project successfully, different methods and tools are required.
            When creating a digital project such as an adventure game, a software and a coding language are required as skills. 
            A coding language such as Python is needed to carry out functions that would create a back end application for the game. 
            To make the game appealing in terms of visual design, front end coding languages such as HTML and CSS are very beneficial. 
            The most common sources used in order to edit and carry out coding is visual studio code (VS code). All these methods are needed to carefully plan to deliver successful results.

        <h2 class = "title">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
        <div id = "content3" class = "content">
            <p>
            It is very important to plan the project to carry out tasks efficiently. This can be done by using IT platforms such as trello and slack. 
            Trello board makes it relatively easy to delegate tasks in a team, as it alters all team members of what tasks they have left to do in order to complete the game. 
            For example in games evenly distributing tasks such as storyline, flowchart and coding using trello board will keep the workflow smooth. As the trello board can be accessed by all members,
            they can provide coloured labels to their tasks that can be updated as they progress for example and “Things to do list'' can be moved to another list as takes are completed. 
            This can also be visible to the course submission team, therefore they are aware of the progress.
            Communicating through social platforms such as Slack is also an impact aspect in planning and carrying out tasks, as each member can agree on what tasks they want to carry out before starting the project.

        <h2 class = "title">1.4 Risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
        <div id = "content4" class = "content">
           <p>
            The key principle that can cause the project to fail is unprotected internet. 
            It is vital to have up to date antiviruses installed in order to protect the computer system from incoming threats that can possibly hack the data
            in the game project and give errors as a result. To prevent this, it is important to download antiviruses when warned. 
            Another aspect that can cause digital projects to fail is human error. This can include not backing up and storing files potentially losing work; 
            opening and responding to spam emails that may hack the computer system and making minor errors in the code that majorly affect the function of the game. In orto to prevent files and information of the project from being lost, 
            it is crucial to secure them under cloud server (back up), so they are secure. It’s very easy to make common mistakes that can cause errors in the development of the project for example, in python, 
            forgetting to call out function at the end will cause error when running the game. Therefore testing the game multiple times will prevent it from falling to function.

        <h2 class="title">1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
        <div id = "content5" class = "content">
            <p>
            Selection for the type of IT system and software is dependent on what type digital project is being created. 
            If creating an adventure game, Python is a very useful coding language, as its main role is to script language for a web application. 
            In a game where the basic storyline is to make a player travel through locations to reach a destination, python defines functions to be printed, using VS code as a resource. 
            VS code will make it much easier to test the code and fix errors. HTML and CSS are the front end coding languages that will be applied to display the game on a webpage. 
            When applied correctly, all these skills and methods should create a successful functioning digital project.

        <h2 class = "title">1.6 Analysis of chosen technologies that help achieve outcomes.</h2>
        <div id = "content6" class="content">
            <p>
            There are many technologies that help plan and execute the project. One of these technologies is a trello board.
            Using a trello board, it decreases the chance of completing between tasks that are needed to be completed, as the tools available to organize tasks that can be traced as the work progresses.
            Another technology that helps achieve successful outcomes from the project is a hosting service called GitHub. 
            GitHub can be used to upload the game to and update its programmes to the newest version using version control system “Git”. 
            Therefore the game will always be at its highest quality in comparison to other projects on GitHub. The projects created are here to be seen by other developers and employers,
            increasing the chance of access into the software development field.

        <h2 class= "title">1.7 GDPR Gudielines</h2>
        <div id = "content7" class = "content">
            <p>
            General data protection regulation (GDPR) is a privacy law that was put into action in May 2018. Its purpose is to ensure personal data of individuals is protected when processed by external sources. 
            Since that law was introduced, it has largely impacted digital projects and platforms that process data.
            <br>
            <br> 
            For example, in recruitment the majority of the companies now take online CV applications as GDPR requires employers to hold responsibility for protecting data of the candidate, 
            as it includes these include name, address and contact details.
            According to GDPR this makes the employers the “Data Controllers” and candidates the “Data Subjects”.
            <br>
            <br>
            If software technology is not used correctly (following the GDPR laws), data breach can occur, which can negatively impact data in project or any other data online.
            For example in 2016, a massive data breach took place in 2016 when a third party exposed personal data of more than thousand healthcare workers. This did not only break the GDPR law, 
            but potentially allow hackers to intervene with NHS patients data, as they would be able to access the data.
            Therefore it is really important to protect information using software technology in today's society.
