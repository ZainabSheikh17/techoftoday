                    VS code is a very useful tool as it allows user to apply majority of coding languages. 
                    In oder to create the website Html and CSS were both usable at the same time, 
                    which is makes the workflow very efficient. VS code is extremely productive as it’s keyboard short-cut mappings can easily used to navigate the code. 
                    Another very supportive tool that assisted in creating the website was “ Trello Board”. 
                    Using Trello reduces many challenges as its functions break down tasks, making it very easy to track the progress of the website.

            <h2 class= "title">2.2 Whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
            <div id = "content2" class = "content">
                <p>
                    When compared to other sources available to edit code, VS code seems to be the appropriate in terms of quality and diversity. 
                    Through VS code, it is very easy to apply multiple codes at once, which is not available in many other code editing sources. 
                    Trello is  also an appropriate platform to use for organisation as it allows user to access various tools to segregate tasks, 
                    according to their preference. As the platform is public, it also builds good communication with co workers as they can all have access 
                    to the progress of the website. 
                </p>

            <h2 class = "title">2.3 Strengths and weaknesses of the final project</h2>
            <div id = "content3" class = "content">
                <p>
                    The outcome of the website is very satisfactory as, when all functions applied, 
                    the results come out as desired. Using trail and error makes it much easier to test the code also keeps proof reading the code. 
                    Adding colour and positioning text through CSS, the visuals results of the website were adequate to what was needed. 
                    However if give more time its is possible to improve the quality of the website using more coding methods and make changes,
                    therefore updating the website. 
                </p>
        </div>
            <h2 class = "title">2.4 Further improvements that can be made to the project</h2>
            <div id = "content4" class = "content">
               <p>
                   It is possible if more practice and knowledge on coding was given, 
                   the standard of website could have been better. It became slightly difficult to carry 
                   put all tasks in a short span of time, if give more time to complete the website, 
                   the quality could have been improved. Therefore if give chance again, 
                   changes can be implemented with more coding methods such as adding adding more 
                   links and colour themes. 
               </p>
        </div>
            <h2 class="title">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
            <div id = "content5" class = "content">
                <p>
                    When tested the website appears to look as what was required. The website appears to function correctly 
                    when all coding is implemented and tested. It serves the purpose that the website was, 
                    as upon clicking all links and buttons navigate to the right pages and sites, ensuring there are no errors. 
                    When shown and reviewed to external sources, the layout of the website is appreciated proving it is matching 
                    the correct requirements.
