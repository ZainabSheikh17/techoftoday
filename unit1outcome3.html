                        As this website was an individual project as compared to the game project earlier in the course, 
                        it gave liberty of creativity. It allowed independent search that bought new ideas that no had control over. 
                        Doing this as an individual project also gives extra value to credits.                                                                                                                               
                        However the efficiency of the website project good have been improved if created in team Team work would have bought 
                        more ideas to the table that one may have missed out on. As the tasks could have been evaded through trello, 
                        its possible that workflow would have been carrie out with more ease.

                    <p>
                        The productivity of the project could have been improved if the course was held at the code nation 
                        campus rather than virtual learning. This would have benefited the work ethic by making it more efficient, 
                        as in person communication would have made it much easier to approach tutors for help and vice versa. 
                        On campus communication between co workers could have also improved work ethic as they could have supported each other 
                        in complication tasks at all times.

                        Slack and trello came as solution that highly improved the productivity of the project. 
                        Slack allowed communication with tutors as well as the team. This made it easy to pass around ideas and questions 
                        for both the game and website project, as all members were all to support each other with tasks. 
                        Trello also eased the communication with turtles and team members as it can be accessed publicly, 
                        therefore every one was able to track the progress.

                        In oder to test and review the website, it was observed by external sources such as family members to
                        check if they like the lay out of the website from visual point. This includes, the sharpness of the colours
                        theme; the size and font of the text; the ease of using the website (it’s functions) and many other observant aspects. 
                        It is very important to ensure that there no human errors while exiting the website, as it can heavily impact the results. 
                        For example a simple error in coding such as “not closing a bracket” can impact the result of the website, therefore testing 
                        the website every time its is updated is very vital.
