                        which websites also fall under. The law serves the purpose of constraining others individuals or companies 
                        from using content of other sources. If someone is to use an image from a different sources they would need to 
                        pay a particular amount for it as they would not hold authority. If connect is stolen or taken without permission, 
                        the original content creator can claim up to 500,000. Alternatively, there are few amateur websites that use 
                        content from external sources while giving them credit. for example when an image from original creator is taken, 
                        a blurred name of the creator appear on the image.

                        To improve these issues, features can be added onto the website. People who suffer from epilepsy may be at risk 
                        if flashy images are used. To avoid this, images with subtle colours can be used. 
                        In order to help partially blind people read the written connect better, a magnifying glass effect can be added.
                        It is very important to take in account of all communities access to website, therefore all precautions needed to 
                        be taken including disable community.

                        The main tow types of files used in a website are JPG (Joint Picture Expert Group) and  PNG (Portable Network Graphics). 
                        To determine which file is appropriate for the website is dependant on how it impacts the website. 
                        For example the speed of the page can be negatively effected if incorrect file  (that doesn't support the 
                        format) is used. Many websites use vector images (with no background colour) that are saved and used as SVG.              
                        File formats such as MP3 can be really appropriate to use if an audio recording has to added onto the website.
